CVE-2018-1002200
org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-archiver is a Collection of Plexus components to create archives or extract files out of an archive to a directory with a unified Archiver/UnArchiver API whatever the archive format is. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip"). It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily. The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in /root/.ssh/ overwriting the authorized_keys file: +2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt +2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

CVE-2019-17513
io.ratpack:ratpack-core is a simple, capable, toolkit for creating high performance web applications. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting. If untrusted and unsanitized data is used to populate the headers of an HTTP response, an attacker can utilize this vulnerability to have the server issue any HTTP response they specify. The root cause was due to using the netty DefaultHttpHeaders object with verification disabled. If your application uses arbitrary user input as the value of a response header it is vulnerable. If your application does not use arbitrary values as response header values, it is not vulnerable.

CVE-2020-28493
Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional sandboxed environment. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the _punctuation_re regex operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This issue can be mitigated by using Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts or limiting process memory.

CVE-2020-7655
netius is a Python network library that can be used for the rapid creation of asynchronous non-blocking servers and clients. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be possible due to incorrect Transfer encoding header parsing which could allow for CL:TE or TE:TE attacks. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.

CVE-2020-7692
com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client is a powerful and easy-to-use Java library for the OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 authorization standards. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Authorization. PKCE support is not implemented in accordance with the RFC for OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps. Without the use of PKCE, the authorization code returned by an authorization server is not enough to guarantee that the client that issued the initial authorization request is the one that will be authorized. An attacker is able to obtain the authorization code using a malicious app on the client-side and use it to gain authorization to the protected resource.

CVE-2020-7694
uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Log Injection. The request logger provided by the package is vulnerable to ASNI escape sequence injection. Whenever any HTTP request is received, the default behaviour of uvicorn is to log its details to either the console or a log file. When attackers request crafted URLs with percent-encoded escape sequences, the logging component will log the URL after it's been processed with urllib.parse.unquote, therefore converting any percent-encoded characters into their single-character equivalent, which can have special meaning in terminal emulators. By requesting URLs with crafted paths, attackers can: Pollute uvicorn's access logs, therefore jeopardising the integrity of such files.Use ANSI sequence codes to attempt to interact with the terminal emulator that's displaying the logs (either in real time or from a file).PoC async def app(scope, receive, send):print(scope) assert scope['type'] == 'http' await send({'type': 'http.response.start','status': 200,'headers': [[b'Content-Type', b'text/plain']]})  await send({'type': 'http.response.body','body': b'Hello, world!',})`curl -v 'http://localhost:9999/logfile-injection%20HTTP%2f1.1%22%20200%20OK%0d%0aINFO:%20%20%20%20%208.8.8.8:1337%20-%20%22POST%20/admin/fake-action&amp;#39;$ cat log.txtINFO:     127.0.0.1:49242 - "GET /logfile-injection HTTP/1.1" 200 OKINFO:     8.8.8.8:1337 - "POST /admin/fake-action HTTP/1.1" 200 OKThe previous GET request added a fake entry to the log file, stating that the host at 8.8.8.8 made a POST request to /admin/fake-action.
